# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

<text placeholder>

### Tasks

#### [0-holberton.c](./0-holberton.c)
###### title: _putchar

For this task we have to write a program that print `Holberton`, followed by a new line, using `_putchar()`.
This first task is also use to check if we added `int _putchar(char c);` correctly to the `holberton.h` file.

```
$ ./0-holberton
Holberton
$ 
```

#### [1-alphabet.c](./1-alphabet.c)
###### title: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

For this task create a function that print the alphabet on a line + newline after as well as have to add the prototype: `void print_alphabet(void);` to my `holberton.h` file. I'm also barred from using standard libs, only `_putchar()`

```
$ ./1-alphabet
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
$
```

#### [0. _putchar](./0-holberton.c)
###### title: 0. _putchar
```
$ hello world
```

#### [0. _putchar](./0-holberton.c)
###### title: 0. _putchar
```
$ hello world
```
